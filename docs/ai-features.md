# AI Features in CodexPad

CodexPad integrates lightweight AI capabilities to enhance your productivity while maintaining privacy.

## Tag Suggestions

The tag suggestion system analyzes your snippet content and recommends relevant tags:

- **How it works**: As you write content, the system identifies key topics and concepts
- **Benefits**: Saves time and ensures consistent tagging across your snippet library
- **Usage**: Tag suggestions appear below your existing tags when editing a snippet
- **Privacy**: All processing happens locally in your browser using TensorFlow.js

## Content Summarization

The summarization feature creates concise previews of your snippets:

- **How it works**: Automatically extracts the most relevant information from your snippets
- **Benefits**: Quickly identify snippets in the list view without reading the full content
- **Usage**: Summaries are displayed automatically in the snippet list
- **Intelligence**: Prioritizes code-related content and key information

## Technical Implementation

Both features use lightweight machine learning models:

- Built with TensorFlow.js for client-side processing
- No data leaves your device
- Models adapt to your content over time
- Fall back to simpler algorithms when needed for performance

## Future Enhancements

Planned AI improvements include:
- Enhanced search capabilities with semantic matching
- Code completion suggestions
- Related snippet recommendations
